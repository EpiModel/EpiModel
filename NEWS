Version 1.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES
* Added three new extraction functions for network models (get_network,
  get_transmat, and get_nwstats) which extract the network objects, transmission
  matrices, and data frame of network statistics from a completed netsim
  simulation.
* For stochastic epidemic plots, added an option mean.smooth. If TRUE, this
  uses a lowess smoother on the outcome variables of interest. This is helpful
  in visualization of low-count outcomes like disease incidence.
* Automatic parallelization of network models is now possible with the
  netsim_parallel function. Note that this is experimental and has not been
  tested extensively across platforms, so bug reports are welcome.
* Added an argument, skip.check, for the control settings in both ICM and network
  model classes, which overrides the default error checking of parameters,
  initial conditions, and control settings. This should only be used for original
  models with new modules that may unnecessarily trigger a check error.
* In network models, two preset functions have been changed to replaceable
  modules: edges_correct and verbose.net. The former performs the adjustment to
  the edges coefficient for network models with population size changes, in order
  to preserve the mean degree; for mass action epidemic models, for example,
  one would not want this adjustment, so the module should be set to NULL in
  control.net. The latter performs the printing of simulation results to the
  console. Both functions are now listed in the modules help file accessed by:
  help(modules.net).
* Added progress bars for netdx simulations for computationally intensive
  parts of the simulations.
* The x argument in netsim may now be a list of netest objects. This would be
  used only if supplying new simulation modules that know how to process that
  data structure. A motivation for this is to allow original models with
  multiple networks simulated (e.g., a main partnership network and a casual
  partnership network).

USER INTERFACE CHANGES
* The internal representation of disease status as an individual-level attribute
  in the stochastic ICM and network models has been changed from number (0, 1, 2)
  to character ("s", "i", "r"). This has few user implications for running the
  integrated models, but one is that the status vector passed into the initial
  conditions functions must now be in this new format. This also impacts the
  expansion of EpiModel for original models.
* The zeromarg argument has been removed from plot.netsim for static network
  plots (type = "network") to reduce potential issues with setting default
  margins on plots. Now they must explicitly be set with standard par options.

API CHANGES
* The ordering of built-in modules within a time step for network simulations
  has been changed such that the network resimulation module is run before the
  infection module. There should be no substantive differences in model results,
  but this provides a more logical consistency between edges toggled on at a
  time step and the infections that may occur over those edges.
* Evaluation of parameters, initial conditions, and control settings in the
  core parameterization functions is now more stable, and also more flexible.
  Defaults for the fixed arguments are now included in the documentation.
* Users may now bypass the built-in param, init, and control functions altogether
  for original ICM and network models, because the definition of new and
  replacement modules occurs within the control functions themselves. The
  existing control functions should be used as a template if one is considering
  replacing these parameterization functions.
* Users may also bypass any of the built-in modules in network models (see the
  list in control.net) by setting the argument for that module to NULL.

BUG FIXES
* Minor updates and bug fixes to the two built-in Shiny applications (accessed
  via the epiweb function). These apps now benefit from the more stable
  parameterization functions mentioned above.
* Updated the print method for the param.net class to handle parameters that are
  lists or data frames.

OTHER
* Added new test cases for running new DCMs, ICMs, and network models, following
  the vignette examples.


Version 1.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTERFACE CHANGES
* The trans.rate and trans.rate.g2/m2 parameters have been renamed to inf.prob
  and inf.prob.g2/m2 to better characterize that they are probabilities, rather
  than rates, and towards infection of persons in that group/mode.
* Added new documentation for newly exported utility functions for network models,
  mostly used in the birth/entry modules. Now users may directly edit these
  modules and use the utility functions without explicitly adding them to the
  global environment.
* Added warning message for network models in which there is a vertex attribute
  for status added to the network but not referenced in the formation formula,
  in which case the initial conditions for status will still be derived from the
  input for init.net. This does not apply to "serosorting models", which reference
  status in the formation formula, and which require setting status as a vertex
  attribute on the network before calling netest.

BUG FIXES
* Network models with passed network attributes in the formation formula in open
  populations now do not generate an error for persistent ID numbers in the latest
  versions of the tergm and networkDynamic package.
* Fix bug in printing simulation progress in network and ICM class models when
  verbose is not specified in the control settings.
* Running netdx diagnostics with offset terms in the formation no longer generates
  an error.
* Simulating an SIR serosorting network epidemic model (status in the formation
  formula) no longer stops due to missing r.num in init.net.
* Fix bug when calling netdx for one simulation only with a network model fit with
  the full STERGM method (i.e., using the edapprox = FALSE in netest).

OTHER
* The dissolution_coefs function now stores and prints the death/exit rate.
* Removed explicit parameters for xlim, ylim, and main from plot.dcm and plot.icm
  functions, although they still may be passed through the ... argument.
* Introduction vignette has been updated to list new EpiModel website.


Version 1.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES
* Added coef.form argument to netest for network model formation formulas with
  offset terms.
* Allow edge duration of 1 in netest when using the edges dissolution approximation
  (handles one-off partnerships in network models when using the approximation).
* Death modules for network models are now contained in one function, deaths.net,
  to facilitate replacement death modules from users. This is also now consistent
  with the death module for ICMs.
* Automated plotting of target statistic lines to plot.netsim formation plots,
  matching the methods of plot.netdx formation plots.

BUG FIXES
* netdx now simulates from a different starting network at the begining of each
  dynamic simulation, eliminating correlation at time 1 across simulations.
* Can now pass status.vector into init.net for bipartite simulations.
* Several plotting and printing bugs fixed.
* Fixed bug in network models for open populations in which an attribute was
  passed to the network in the formation formula (e.g., serostatus mixing models).

OTHER
* Added internal test structure for build checking.
* Added a help file document for building ICM modules at ?modules.icm.
* Expanded and clarified tutorial documentation, available at:
  http://statnet.github.io/EpiModel


Version 1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Model parameterization for all model classes has been substantially revised
  to improve organization and ability for expansion. Whereas previous models
  required input of parameters directly into the main functions (now: dcm, icm,
  and netsim), now the parameters are input into three parameter-processing
  functions: param, init, and control. The param function sets the core
  epidemic parameters, the init function sets the initial conditions, and the
  control function specifies other model settings. These functions are
  class-specific, so each function has a .dcm, .icm, or .net suffix.

* Modeling functions have been renamed for clarity and consistency:
  - dcm is now used for deterministic compartmental models (replaces epiDCM)
  - icm is now used for stochastic individual contact models (replaces epiICM)
  - netest is now used for network model estimation (replaces epiNet.est)
  - netsim is now used for network model simulation (replaces epiNet.simTrans)

* Network models with independence between epidemic/demographic processes and
  network structures (independent models) were previously first simulated with
  epiNet.simNet, and then those pre-simulated networks were input to
  epiNet.simTrans. Now the network model simulation is all handled within the
  simulation function, netsim.

* Network model diagnostics have been moved from within the network estimation
  process (netest) to their own function: netdx. The parameter names for running,
  printing, and plotting the results of these diagnostics have been updated for
  consistency. See ?netdx and related functions.

* Internal model functions have been significantly revised to improve efficiency.

* The dcm function can handle model functions, parameter sets, and initial
  conditions of arbitrary complexity. See the HTML vignette on this topic at:
  http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/NewDCMs.html

* Moved the package vignettes external to the package to reduce package size and
  build time. They are now available at the EpiModel homepage at:
  http://statnet.org/trac/wiki/EpiModel
