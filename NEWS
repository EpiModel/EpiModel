Version 1.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES
* Network models with passed network attributes in the formation formula in open
  populations now do not generate an error for persistent ID numbers in the latest
  versions of the tergm and networkDynamic package.
* Fix bug in printing simulation progress in network and ICM class models when
  verbose is not specified in the control settings.

OTHER
* The dissolution_coefs function now stores and prints the death/exit rate if one
  is supplied.
* Introduction vignette has been updated to list new EpiModel website.

Version 1.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES
* Added coef.form argument to netest for network model formation formulas with
  offset terms.
* Allow edge duration of 1 in netest when using the edges dissolution approximation
  (handles one-off partnerships in network models when using the approximation).
* Death modules for network models are now contained in one function, deaths.net,
  to facilitate replacement death modules from users. This is also now consistent
  with the death module for ICMs.
* Automated plotting of target statistic lines to plot.netsim formation plots,
  matching the methods of plot.netdx formation plots.

BUG FIXES
* netdx now simulates from a different starting network at the begining of each
  dynamic simulation, eliminating correlation at time 1 across simulations.
* Can now pass status.vector into init.net for bipartite simulations.
* Several plotting and printing bugs fixed.
* Fixed bug in network models for open populations in which an attribute was
  passed to the network in the formation formula (e.g., serostatus mixing models).

OTHER
* Added internal test structure for build checking.
* Added a help file document for building ICM modules at ?modules.icm.
* Expanded and clarified tutorial documentation, available at:
  http://statnet.github.io/EpiModel


Version 1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Model parameterization for all model classes has been substantially revised
  to improve organization and ability for expansion. Whereas previous models
  required input of parameters directly into the main functions (now: dcm, icm,
  and netsim), now the parameters are input into three parameter-processing
  functions: param, init, and control. The param function sets the core
  epidemic parameters, the init function sets the initial conditions, and the
  control function specifies other model settings. These functions are
  class-specific, so each function has a .dcm, .icm, or .net suffix.

* Modeling functions have been renamed for clarity and consistency:
  - dcm is now used for deterministic compartmental models (replaces epiDCM)
  - icm is now used for stochastic individual contact models (replaces epiICM)
  - netest is now used for network model estimation (replaces epiNet.est)
  - netsim is now used for network model simulation (replaces epiNet.simTrans)

* Network models with independence between epidemic/demographic processes and
  network structures (independent models) were previously first simulated with
  epiNet.simNet, and then those pre-simulated networks were input to
  epiNet.simTrans. Now the network model simulation is all handled within the
  simulation function, netsim.

* Network model diagnostics have been moved from within the network estimation
  process (netest) to their own function: netdx. The parameter names for running,
  printing, and plotting the results of these diagnostics have been updated for
  consistency. See ?netdx and related functions.

* Internal model functions have been significantly revised to improve efficiency.

* The dcm function can handle model functions, parameter sets, and initial
  conditions of arbitrary complexity. See the HTML vignette on this topic at:
  http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/NewDCMs.html

* Moved the package vignettes external to the package to reduce package size and
  build time. They are now available at the EpiModel homepage at:
  http://statnet.org/trac/wiki/EpiModel


Version 0.95
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INITIAL RELEASE

* The EpiModel package provides functions for building, solving, and
  plotting mathematical models of infectious disease.

* See the main package help function ?EpiModel-package, and the EpiModel tutorials
  online at http://statnet.org/trac/wiki/EpiModel to get started.
