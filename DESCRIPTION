Title: Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Disease
Description: Tools for simulating mathematical models of infectious disease.
    Epidemic model classes include deterministic compartmental models,
    stochastic agent-based, and stochastic network models. Network models use
    robust statistical methods of exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs)
    from the Statnet suite of software packages in R. Standard templates for epidemic
    modeling include SI, SIR, and SIS disease types. EpiModel features
    an easy API for extending these templates to address novel scientific research
    aims.
