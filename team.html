                <p>
                    Samuel Jenness, PhD is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the Rollins 
                    School of Public Health at Emory University. He is the Principal Investigator of the EpiModel 
                    Research Lab, funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control 
                    and Prevention. His research focuses on developing methods and software tools for modeling infectious 
                    diseases, with primary applications focused on understanding HIV and STI transmission in the United 
                    States and globally. He also works on epidemiological problems at the intersection of infectious 
                    diseases and network science, including measurement and quantification of dynamic social and genomic 
                    networks for HIV/STIs and tuberculosis. He received his PhD in Epidemiology at the University of 
                    Washington, prior to which he conducted applied prevention research at the health departments of 
                    New York City and Massachusetts.</p>

                <p>
                    Dr. Martina Morris's primary contributions to science have been statistical methods for
                    network analysis, with applications to the population dynamics of HIV
                    transmission. For two decades, she has co-led (with Drs. Mark S. Handcock
                    and Steven Goodreau), the NIH-funded team that developed the Exponential
                    family Random Graph Models (ERGMs) framework for statistical network
                    analysis. Their methods are designed to work with both sampled and census
                    network data, and are published in a suite of open-source R packages under
                    the statnet organization on CRAN and GitHub. Over the last decade, with
                    Dr. Sam Jenness, they extended this foundation to develop a comprehensive,
                    principled framework for stochastic modeling of epidemics on dynamic
                    networks that is now implemented in the open-source software package
                    EpiModel. Her current applied research projects focus on the application
                    of these methods to local HIV prevention planning efforts. She is committed
                    to the development of innovative statistical methodology that addresses
                    critical needs in public health, to applications of these methods to
                    support HIV prevention efforts, and to a transparent, reproducible science
                    workflow, ensuring access to the methodology by creating open-source,
                    user-friendly tools.</p>

                <h4>Steven M. Goodreau, PhD</h4>
                <p>
                    Steven M. Goodreau, PhD is a Professor of Biological Anthropology and Adjunct Professor of Epidemiology 
                    at the University of Washington (UW).  He received his PhD from Penn State in 2001, where his work focused on 
                    the intersections of population genetics, social network analysis and demography in the context of HIV evolution.  
                    He has been at UW since then, as an active member of the Statnet Development Team and co-lead of the Network 
                    Modeling Group. Among his administrative hats is Development Director for Center for Studies in Demography and 
                    Ecology (CSDE), UW's NIH-funded population center. Dr. Goodreau's modeling work focuses primarily on the epidemiology of 
                    HIV among men who have sex with men, both domestically and internationally, with interests in both the origin of 
                    disparities and the likely impact of interventions. He maintains additional research foci on the evolution of HIV 
                    virulence, and on sexual health among adolescents more broadly.</p>
