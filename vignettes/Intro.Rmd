The **EpiModel** package provides tools for building, solving, and plotting mathematical models of infectious disease in `R`. It is part of the **Statnet** suite of software for the representation and analysis of networks. **EpiModel** currently provides functionality for three classes of epidemic models and three disease types for modeling. Built-in model classes and types may be expanded by the user for new research.

This vignette is a placeholder for the **EpiModel** tutorials, all hosted online and external to the package to minimize overhead and provide flexibility in updates. Everything may be found at the **EpiModel** website: http://epimodel.org/

Within the package, please consult the extensive help documentation:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(package = "EpiModel")
```

To see the latest updates to **EpiModel**, consult the software `NEWS`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
news(package = "EpiModel")
```

If using the **EpiModel** package for research, we request that you acknowledge this by citing the software in any publications:
