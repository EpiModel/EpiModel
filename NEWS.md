EpiModel 1.8.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BUG FIXES
* Improve error handling for inputs to `dissolution_coefs`.
* Skip dissolution diagnostics in `netdx` if a static ERGM is passed.

### NOTE
* This will be the last version of EpiModel 1.0 before major revisions to the 
  package infrastructure and API to be released in EpiModel 2.0. 


EpiModel 1.7.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Add foundation updates to support the `tergmLite` package (to be released). 
* Print network statistic diagnostics stored in `netsim` object with 
  `print.netsim(x, formation.stats = TRUE)`.

### BUG FIXES
* Fix issue `plot.netsim` default colors when number of variables exceeds 3.

### OTHER
* Add example for differential homophily in a TERGM dissolution model in 
  `dissolution_coefs` documentation.

EpiModel 1.7.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Add a `skip.dissolution` argument to `netdx` to skip dissolution diagnostics 
  for computational efficiency.

### BUG FIXES
* Fixes output formatting of network stats saved during `netsim` runs. 
* Correctly errors when running dynamic network diagnostics with `netdx` on a 
  cross-sectional ergm. 
* Remove old unused utility functions.
* Enforce depend on ergm >= 3.10 package.


EpiModel 1.7.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BUG FIXES
* Fix logical evaluations in `get_sims` and unit tests in `plot.transmat` found
  during CRAN submission for v1.7.1.


EpiModel 1.7.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Two helper functions, `get_args` and `apportion_lr`, ported over from 
  EpiModelHIV.
* Two custom ERGM terms, `absdiffby` and `absdiffnodemix`, ported over from
  EpiModelHIV.


### BUG FIXES
* Fix linked functions in embedded Shiny apps broken in v1.7.0.
* Update handling of parameter and module name changes related to births/deaths
  to arrivals/departures renames in v1.7.0.
* Reduce complexity of verbose output so that it can generalize across EpiModel
  extension packages.
* Fix bug in `as.data.frame.dcm` when `dt` control setting < 1.


EpiModel 1.7.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Add `keep.tnetwork` parameter to `netdx` to allow for retaining the full 
  `networkDynamic` object during dynamic network simulations. Relatedly, add
  support for `get_network` to extract those networks from `netdx` objects.
* Change the default handling of `as.data.frame` function for processing model
  output for all three model classes (DCM, ICM, and Network Models) to generate
  a stacked data frame of all simulations (instead of row means across 
  simulations). **This is a breaking change that may require updating old code.**
* New `as.data.frame.netdx` function extracts the timed edgelists directly from
  a `netdx` object.
* The `get_nwstats` function now extracts data frames of network statistics from
  both `netdx` and `netsim` objects.

### BUG FIXES
* Improve functionality and error handling of `get_sims`.
* Fix problems with color handling of network statistics plots in `plot.netdx`
  and `plot.netsim`. 
* Enforce maximum number `ncores` argument in `netdx` to prevent over 
  parallelization of simulations.
* Removed the redundant storage of the timed edgelist data in `netdx` objects.
* Fix errors in calculation of population sizes in verbose module that prints
  simulation output to the console.

### OTHER
* Add warning for input parameter with a name `act.rate.m2` for network models
  in `param.net`, as this is an unused parameter for built-in models.
* Updated parameters and documentation throughout EpiModel for vital dynamics
  parameters and processes to reflect a more general method of demographic 
  in-flows and out-flows from the population. Previous terms were births and 
  deaths; new terms are arrivals and departures. The default parameter for 
  births was previously `b.rate`; it is now `a.rate`. Inputs of a `b.rate` 
  parameter yield a message and will automatically set `a.rate` to the `b.rate`
  value. **This is a breaking change that may require updating old code.**
* Adapted y-axis limit calculation for all stochastic plots to depend on dynamic
  range of data displayed instead of full data range. 
* Changed the default plot type for static diagnostics in `netdx` (when `dynamic`
  is set to `FALSE`) to smoothed rolling averages instead of the full MCMC trace.
  The trace plots may be turned back on with `sim.lines = TRUE`.

<br>


EpiModel 1.6.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* `netdx` now includes a new argument, `sequential`, for static diagnostics
  that mirrors the same argument from `ergm::simulate.ergm` to simulate from
  MCMC chains based on previous draws versus new draws.

### BUG FIXES
* Fix `mutate_epi` output when new variable is a constant.

### OTHER
* Move `ggplot2` from depend to import.
* References added for publication of Journal of Statistical Software methods
  paper on EpiModel: Jenness SM, Goodreau SM, Morris M. EpiModel: An R Package 
  for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Disease over Networks. _Journal of 
  Statistical Software._ 2018; 84(8): 1-47. DOI: 10.18637/jss.v084.i08.

<br>


EpiModel 1.6.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### OTHER
* Fixed minor issue with unit tests using `identical` function causing some to
  fail under alternative BLAS/LAPACK implementations.

<br>


EpiModel 1.6.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* `as.data.frame` methods for `netsim` and `icm` classes now allow creation of a
  single data frame with epidemic outcomes across multiple simulations, where
  previous only single individual simulations would be output. This is specified
  with the `sim = "all"` parameter when `out = "vals"`. See the help page for
  examples. This "tidy" data format allows for easier integration with external
  plotting and analysis approaches, including ggplot2.
* `geom_bands` is a new "geom" for use by `ggplot2` to facilitate plotting of
  simulation intervals given a specified lower and upper quantile set. Examples
  of plotting ICM simulations are provided, and the same principle applies for
  network models. As a result of this, `ggplot2` was added as a depend.
* `truncate_sims` is a new utility function that takes truncates the time series
  of a `netsim` or `icm` class object at a specified time step. This truncation
  will remove all epidemic output before that time step, and reset the control
  settings to start at that time step. This is useful in our modeling workflows
  when we need to remove a pre-intervention burnin period from the model
  simulations.
* `init.net` allows you to pass in a vector of backwards-looking infection times
  for those initally infected at t_1 through the `infTime.vector` parameter.
  Combined with the `status.vector` parameter, this provides users maximal control
  over who is infected and for how long as initial conditions.

### BUG FIXES
* Fixed bug in DCM Shiny app related to plotting prevalence vs count outcomes.
* Removed unneeded and unused input parameters from `discord_edgelist` function.
* Fixed issue where SIS/SIR models with vital dynamics, and a low mortality rate
  relative to the recovery rate (which is typical) would get very long initial
  infection times assigned at t_1.

### OTHER
* Changed the title (actually, it's a subtitle) in the DESCRIPTION to: "Mathematical
  Modeling of Infectious Disease Dynamics".
* Deprecated the `status.rand` argument for `init.net` and `init.icm` that allowed
  users to specify a random number of initially infected. Support for this got
  too complex for a little (or never) used argument, and users interested in
  randomly setting the initial number infected may control this more flexibly
  with the `status.vector` parameter.

<br>


EpiModel 1.5.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Add `grid` argument to plot functions to overlay a grid on line plots.

### BUG FIXES
* Fix bug in `plot.netdx` examples in help file.

### OTHER
* Reset the `verbose` default for network models to `TRUE` (reverts change in
  v1.3.0 specifically for network models).
* Rename `leg` argument name (to add default legends to plots) to `legend`. Note
  this is backwards-incompatible because of fuzzy matching with other function
  arguments starting `leg`; prior model code must be updated.
* Change default transparency level to 0.5 (if unspecified).

<br>


EpiModel 1.3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* In `control.dcm`, `nsteps` may now be a vector of time steps or, as before, an
  integer containing the number of time steps within a DCM simulation. For example,
  `control.dcm(..., nsteps = seq(1980, 2015, 1/12), ...)` for solve for monthly
  outputs from a range of dates from 1980 to 2015.
* `mutate_epi` for adding new variables to a epidemic simulation object now works
   for all three model classes.

### BUG FIXES
* Outputs from `param`, `init`, and `control` functions are now dual-classed as
  lists as well as their native classes.
* When passing a `new.mod` into `control.dcm`, printing the `control.dcm` object
  no longer yields a warning and instead prints the function name.

### OTHER
* Update handling of transparent colors within `transco` to use the base
  `adjustcolor` function.
* Derivatives tracking a "flow" or the size of a transition between compartments
  for DCM simulations (e.g., disease incidence) often output `NA` for the final
  value, creating issues with analyzing those data. Those `NA`s are replaced with
  the penultimate value of that vector.
* Simplify printing of `dcm`, `icm`, and `netsim` objects to list "Variables"
  together instead of dividing them into compartments, flows, and other.
* Change the `popfrac` default for plotting `dcm`, `icm`, and `netsim` objects
  to `FALSE`. This avoids any problems when prevalences are already stored within
  the model simulation.
* Change the `verbose` default for control functions to `FALSE`.

<br>


EpiModel 1.2.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Print simulation number and prevalence value for static network plots in
  `print.netsim` when `sims` is `mean`, `min`, or `max.

### BUG FIXES
* Add new line at end of `print.coefdiss` output.
* Tighten the default ylim ranges for `plot.netsim`

### OTHER
* Include error check for duration < 1 in `dissolution_coefs`.
* Update documentation in a number of places.

<br>


EpiModel 1.2.7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Add new `mutate_epi` function inspired by the `dplyr` package, to add
  post-hoc summary statistic calculations to completed network simulations.
  See the function help file for examples.
* Added a speedy `get_degree` function that returns a vector of current
  network degree for each person in a network.

### BUG FIXES
* Updated internal plot functions that calculate prevalences.
* Disable verbose output if running network models in parallel.

### OTHER
* Allow network simulations of 1 time step (mainly used for debugging and
  testing).

<br>


EpiModel 1.2.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Updates to `as.phylo.transmat` to fix issues with vertex exit times and to
  now accept multiple seed vertices if multiple seeds are detected, returning
  a list of phylo objects of class `multiPhylo` following the convention of
  `ape::read.tree`.

### BUG FIXES
* Corrected an error governing the birth rate of 2-group, open-population
  deterministic compartmental models (DCMs).

### OTHER
* Updated license to GPL-3.

<br>


EpiModel 1.2.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Added multicore functionality to simulating stochastic network models with `netsim`. This
  only supports single-node frameworks currently, using the `doParallel` package. Run models
  in parallel by using the `ncores` parameter in `control.net`.
* Modifications to the `as.phylo.transmat` function to construct the phylo tree with all
  network vertices as phylo-tips and all transmissions as phylo nodes.

### OTHER
* General code cleanup and improvement of package tests to increase coverage about 90%.

<br>


EpiModel 1.2.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* The stochastic network model Shiny application now features adaptive concurrency
  levels with ERGMs including that network statistic.

### BUG FIXES
* `plot.netsim` now correctly functions for diagnostic plots (`type = "formation"`)
  when summary statistics contain variable names with numeric values as suffixes.
* Avoided duplicate reinitialization of persistent IDs for network models started
  with a full STERGM fit (`edapprox = FALSE` in the `netest` function).
* Fixed error for stochastic network model simulations in `netest` when models
  were fit with the full STERGM method.
* Automatically set `depend` parameter to `TRUE` in `control.net` when user
  passes in any new birth or death modules.

<br>


EpiModel 1.2.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* New translation and plotting functions for temporal transmission chains measured
  in stochastic network models. These include a dendogram using methods from the
  `ape` package and a transmission timeline from the `ndtv` package. See the help
  files for the `as.phylo.transmat` and `plot.transmat` functions.
* Added a Shiny application for stochastic network models. This may be accessed
  from within the package with `epiweb(class = "net")`. It is also hosted online
  at http://statnet.shinyapps.io/epinet/
* `get_sims` function is used to extract individual simulations from larger `netsim`
  objects. This function has been updated to include a `var` argument that allows
  for automatic calculation of which simulation is closest to the mean across
  all simulations for extraction.
* Added a quantile extraction method for `as.data.frame` method for `icm` and
  `netsim` classes. This will provide a data frame of output corresponding to
  defined quantiles across all simulations contained within a model object.

### BUG FIXES
* Supress warnings with the lowess smoother in `plot.netsim` in cases where there
  are `NA` values in the epidemiological output.
* Removed error check for `control.net` when `type` is missing, and automatically
  sets `type` to `"SI"`. This will impact extensions to EpiModel in the case
  when the default transmission module is replaced.
* Fixed bug in `netdx` on calculating summary statistics from models with multiple
  structural zeros for target statistics.

### OTHER
* Changed the default of `status.rand`, which controls whether the number initially
  infected in stochastic epidemic models, to `FALSE`. This will ensure that
  exactly the number specified in `init.icm` and `init.net` are matched in each
  simulation.
* Fully removed the `netsim_parallel` function from the package. See the EpiModelHPC
  extension package at http://github.com/statnet/EpiModelHPC for running network
  simulations in parallel.

<br>


EpiModel 1.2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BUG FIXES
* `check_bip_degdist` now uses more tolerant checks of equality when comparing
  bipartite mode statistics.
* Fixes a formatting issue with output for DCMs run with the `dcm` function.
* Fixes a variable name collision problem for epidemic plotting functions.
* Removes long burn-ins from network model estimation in `netest` to improve
  performance of fitting models.
* In stochastic network models, one may now remove built-in modules, such as
  `births.FUN`, from the dynamic workflow by setting the argument value for that
  module to `NULL` in the `control.net` inputs.

<br>


EpiModel 1.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* The `calc_eql` function now returns test statistics invisibly.
* Major overhaul of plotting functions for stochastic model plots. `plot.netsim`
  is now a separate method for epidemic plots (it was previously a function call
  to `plot.icm`), with function arguments and default settings more consistent
  across plotting functions. There may be minor backwards incompatibility for some
  epidemic plots. Network statistic plots in `plot.netdx` and `plot.netsim` now
  use the same methods and share the same defaults. The defaults for these plots
  will be to plot smoothed quantile bands (the IQR) and means of simulations
  without the individual simulation lines. Any individual elements may be toggled
  on or off as before.
* Modules are now listed in the output for `param.icm` and `param.net` classes.
* Removed `dissolution` argument to `netest`. This argument specified the right-
  hand sided dissolution formula for temporal ERGMs. It was removed because this
  formula was already specified in the `dissolution_coefs` function, the output
  of which is passed to `netest`, thereby removing the duplication.

### BUG FIXES
* `as.data.frame` methods for stochastic models remove `NA` from individual
  simulations when calculating row means.
* Fixed bug in network birth module for assigning infection status for incoming
  nodes.
* The `verbose` parameter in `netest` now correctly controls the model fitting
  output level in the underlying `ergm` and `stergm` functions.
* `merge.netsim` now correctly checks elements of two objects to be merged when
  the classes of those elements may be of length greater than 1.

### OTHER
* Major updated internal package function testing for more reliable performance.
* Added `...` argument to `epiweb` to pass additional arguments to `shiny::runApp`.
* Importing the `graphics`, `grDevices`, `stats`, and `utils` packages as
  required by CRAN.

<br>


EpiModel 1.1.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Built-in parallelization of stochastic network model simulations directly within
  the package with the `netsim_parallel` function has been deprecated. This
  functionality has been replaced with model simulation functions within the
  `EpiModelHPC` extension package: https://github.com/statnet/EpiModelHPC
* Cosmetic and functional updates to built-in Shiny applications accessible within
  the package via `epiweb`.
* New function, `calc_eql`, calculates whether a model of any class in EpiModel
  has reached an equilibrium state over a defined time series. Equilibrium is
  defined as the absolute value of the difference of the maximum prevalence and
  minimum prevalence over a specified time series falling below a specified
  threshold. For stochastic models, these values are calcualted based on the
  mean of the individual time series simulations.
* `netest` now includes a new argument, `nonconv.error`, that will send the
  function to an error state if the ERGM did not coverge after the specified
  number of interations. The default is to allow for a nonconverged model fit
  to be returned. Requiring an error may be helpful when running a number of
  models in batch mode.

### BUG FIXES
* Within the built-in deterministic compartmental models solved with the `dcm`
  function, there was an error in the calculation of flows (e.g., disease incidence
  or number of deaths per unit time) when the models were integrated with methods
  other than the "Euler" solution. Flows are now calculated correctly for all
  numerical integration methods supported via the `deSolve` package.
* Minor bugs in the default deaths module for stochastic network models were
  corrected.

### OTHER
* `netest` will now check to ensure that the formation and dissolution models are
  in allignment (terms specified in the same order) and that dissolution model is
  of proper forms (see v1.1.4 notes).

<br>


EpiModel 1.1.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* A limited set of heterogeneous dissolution models now allowed for network
  models (#184): edges + nodematch, nodemix, or nodefactor formulas now supported.
  See help file for `dissolution_coefs` for examples.
* Network models now feature more consistent and flexible use of persistent IDs
  for networkDynamic objects (#199). This involved adding a new control setting,
  `use.pids` in `control.net`. See help("persistent.ids") in the `networkDynamic`
  package for more background.
* Interventions are added to all model classes (#20). For DCMs, ICMs, and network
  models, there are new parameters, inter.eff and inter.start, for the efficacy
  and starting time of the intervention. This generic intervention has the effect
  of reducing the probability of transmission given a contact between a susceptible
  and infected person by the efficacy parameter.

### BUG FIXES
* Fixed error in `births.net` module that set the default `entrTime` and
  `exitTime` attributes twice for bipartite models (#205).
* Plotting for all model classes now allow setting `xlab` and `ylab` (#206).
* `get_sims` extraction now outputs correct data when object contains single
  simulation.

### OTHER
* More robust testing of functions.
* Updated hyperlinks within doc files to new github-based website.

<br>


EpiModel 1.1.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* The `skip.check` argument for `control.net` is even more flexible, to allow
  for passing different class elements into `netsim` with original models.
* New `param.error` argument for `merge.netsim` that allows bypassing the stop
  error if the parameters and control settings from the two merged objects are
  not identical.
* `control.net` has new `module.order` argument to provide control of the order
  in which modules are evaluated within each time step. The default ordering is
  maintained as explained in the updated help file.

### BUG FIXES
* `netsim_parallel` now returns the correct object if used for single simulations
  or on single cores.
* `plot.icm` removes NA values from the data when calculating `ylim` and the
  quantile bands.

### OTHER
* `netest` now implements an improved "Edges Dissolution Approximation" via the
  `edapprox` argument.
* Several documentation updates.

<br>


EpiModel 1.1.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Implement `control.dcm` option `dede`, which if true allows for delayed
  differential equations to be passed into a new model solved with `dcm`.
* New option for `netdx` to simulate static diagnostics from an ERGM, rather
  than the temporal diagnostics (still the default). This will help better
  diagnose poor dynamic model fit when using the edges dissolution approximation
  (#175).
* Plot option added for `netdx`, with the `method` parameter, to plot boxplots of
  the simulations against the target statistics. The default is still the line
  plots (#191).
* Additional summary elements may now be plotted with `netdx` objects, similar
  to epidemic data plots: mean lines and quantile bands. Additional arguments
  added to allow toggling of these along with individual simulation lines and
  target lines.
* Print method for `netdx` is updated, along with a new statistic for the percent
  deviation between the simulation means and target statistics (#192).
* Added other epidemiological outcomes saved in user-defined modules to print
  output with `print.netsim` (#183).
* New function `get_sims` will subset and extract entire simulations from `netsim`
  objects with multiple simulations. A vector of simulation numbers may be
  specified, or if set as "mean", the simulation with the infected prevalence
  closest to the means across all simulations will be chosen.

### BUG FIXES
* Object elements saved in stochastic network models with the `save.other`
  parameter in `control.net` may now be merged with `merge.netsim` (#185).
* Quantile band is displayed in `plot` for ICMs and network models when the `y`
  argument is specified (#188).

### OTHER
* Package `deSolve` moved from import to depend (#194).

<br>


EpiModel 1.1.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Added dissolution diagnostics in `netdx`, for the proportion of edges that
  dissolve per time step, as another diagnostic for the dissolution model (#53).
* Network plots with `plot.netsim` now allow specifying `"mean"`, `"min"`, or
  `"max"` to plot the network at with the most average, maximum, and minumum
  disease prevalence at the specified time step (#73).
* Network models may now use time-varying recovery rates, similar to the previous
  time-varying infection probabilities and act rates. The documentation for the
  `param.net` function has been updated with details (#65).
* New control setting for DCMs, `param.sens`, that allows bypassing the default
  behavior of evaluating parameters with length greater than 1 as sensitivity
  analyses. This should be used for single-run models if passing in parameters
  with arbitrary form.

### BUG FIXES
* Print functions for initial condition processing functions now handle list and
  data frame structures (#135).
* Fix bug for new DCMs in which the initial condition names include standard
  integrated initial condition names (#160).
* Several bugs fixes related to network diagnostics for models with offset terms
  in the formation model. Also related formation diagnostics plots in
  `plot.netsim` fixed (#164).
* Initialization of infection time for stochastic SIS/SIR models with two groups
  or modes now fixed (#102).
* Edges population size correction module, `edges_correct`, now runs for any
  dependent network simulations, not just if built-in vital dynamics modules are
  called (#141).

### OTHER
* The new website for the EpiModel project is http://epimodel.org/
* Added a new example of a SEIR Ebola DCM in the "Solving New DCMs with EpiModel"
  tutorial.
* The shiny apps now use the single file method (#155).
* Exported and added documentation for the `verbose.icm` function (#71).
* Other elements saved in network simulations with the `save.other` control
  setting in `control.net` are now printed as output in `print.netsim` (#174).

<br>


EpiModel 1.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Added three new extraction functions for network models (`get_network`,
  `get_transmat`, and `get_nwstats`) which extract the network objects,
  transmission matrices, and data frame of network statistics from a completed
  `netsim` simulation. These functions also support extraction of network model
  simulations with multiple networks (see API note).
* The plot function for `netsim` objects now has an argument, network, for
  plotting network statistics and static networks (`type = "formation"` and
  `"network"`, respectively) in simulations with multiple networks.
* For stochastic epidemic plots, added an option `mean.smooth`. If `TRUE`, this
  uses a lowess smoother on the outcome variables of interest. This is helpful
  in visualization of low-count outcomes like disease incidence.
* Automatic parallelization of network models is now possible with the
  `netsim_parallel` function. Note that this is experimental and has not been
  tested extensively across platforms, so bug reports are welcome. Two parallel
  methods are supported: `doParallel` for multiple cores on a single node, and
  `doMPI` for multiple cores across multiple nodes. The latter requires an MPI
  installation on a linux-based cluster.
* Network diagnostics in `netdx` also accepts a new `ncores` argument, which will
  run the diagnostic simulations and calculations on those simulations in
  parallel on a specified number of cores (single node only).
* Added an argument, `skip.check`, for the control settings in both ICM and
  network model classes, which overrides the default error checking of
  parameters, initial conditions, and control settings. This should only be used
  for original models with new modules that may unnecessarily trigger a check
  error.
* Added an argument, `save.other`, for the control settings in network models,
  which is a character vector of other elements from the master data list, `dat`,
  to save out in the simulation.
* Added an argument, `start`, for the control settings in network models, which
  is a starting time step to resume simulations. In this case, the `x` argument
  in `netsim` is a previously saved `netsim` object rather than a `netest`
  object. The `start` argument should be one integer higher than the `nsteps` in
  that earlier `netsim` object. The `nsteps` argument should now be the final
  steps for the simulation. Note that this requires specifying
  `save.other = "attr"` in the control settings, as well as saving the networks.
* Added progress bars for `netdx` diagnostic simulations for computationally
  intensive parts of the simulations.
* Network model estimation with `netest` now provides an output argument. When
  using the edges dissolution approximation (`edapprox = TRUE`), one may set
  output to `"sim"` to save a static simulation network instead of the `ergm`
  object as an element of the `netest` output. This is mainly for file size
  efficiency.

### USER INTERFACE CHANGES
* The internal representation of disease status as an individual-level attribute
  in the stochastic ICM and network models has been changed from number
  `(0, 1, 2)` to character `("s", "i", "r")`. This changes little when running
  the integrated models, and has greater implications for the API when editing
  modules. But one change for integrated models is that the status vector passed
  into the initial conditions functions must now be in this new format. This also
  impacts the expansion of EpiModel for original models.
* The `zeromarg` argument has been removed from `plot.netsim` for static network
  plots (`type = "network"`) to reduce potential issues with setting default
  margins on plots. Now they must explicitly be set with standard par options.

### API CHANGES
* For ICMs and network models, the internal master data object has been renamed
  from `all` to `dat` to prevent function name conflicts. Additionally, all
  summary output is now stored within `dat$epi`, whereas the previous location
  was `all$out`.
* The ordering of built-in modules within a time step for network simulations
  has been changed such that the network resimulation module is run before the
  infection module. There should be no substantive differences in model results,
  but this provides a more logical consistency between edges toggled on at a
  time step and the infections that may occur over those edges.
* In network models, two preset functions have been changed to replaceable
  modules: `edges_correct` and `verbose.net`. The former performs the adjustment
  to the edges coefficient for network models with population size changes, in
  order to preserve the mean degree; for mass action epidemic models, for example,
  one would not want this adjustment, so the module should be set to NULL in
  `control.net`. The latter performs the printing of simulation results to the
  console. Both functions are now listed in the modules help file accessed by:
  `help(modules.net)`.
* Evaluation of parameters, initial conditions, and control settings in the
  core parameterization functions is now more stable, and also more flexible.
  Defaults for the fixed arguments are now included in the documentation.
* Users may now bypass the built-in `param`, `init`, and `control` functions
  altogether for original ICM and network models, because the definition of new
  and replacement modules occurs within the control functions themselves. The
  existing control functions should be used as a template if one is considering
  replacing these parameterization functions.
* Users may also bypass any of the built-in modules in network models (see the
  list in `control.net`) by setting the argument for that module to `NULL`. This
  may be replaced in the future by a user-defined ordered vector of modules.
* The `x` argument in netsim may now be a list of `netest` objects. This would be
  used only if supplying new simulation modules that know how to process that
  data structure. The motivation for this is to allow original models with
  multiple networks simulated (e.g., a main partnership network and a casual
  partnership network).

### BUG FIXES
* Minor updates and bug fixes to the two built-in Shiny applications (accessed
  via the `epiweb` function). These apps now benefit from the more stable
  parameterization functions.
* Updated the `print` method for the `param.net` class to handle parameters that
  are lists or data frames.
* `merge.netsim` now ignores any differences in the environment of the
  `nwstats.formula` control, previously preventing proper merging of some network
  model simulations.

### OTHER
* Added new test cases for running new DCMs, ICMs, and network models, following
  the vignette examples (see http://epimodel.org/).

EpiModel 1.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### INTERFACE CHANGES
* The trans.rate and trans.rate.g2/m2 parameters have been renamed to inf.prob
  and inf.prob.g2/m2 to better characterize that they are probabilities, rather
  than rates, and towards infection of persons in that group/mode.
* Added new documentation for newly exported utility functions for network models,
  mostly used in the birth/entry modules. Now users may directly edit these
  modules and use the utility functions without explicitly adding them to the
  global environment.
* Added warning message for network models in which there is a vertex attribute
  for status added to the network but not referenced in the formation formula,
  in which case the initial conditions for status will still be derived from the
  input for init.net. This does not apply to "serosorting models", which reference
  status in the formation formula, and which require setting status as a vertex
  attribute on the network before calling netest.

### BUG FIXES
* Network models with passed network attributes in the formation formula in open
  populations now do not generate an error for persistent ID numbers in the latest
  versions of the tergm and networkDynamic package.
* Fix bug in printing simulation progress in network and ICM class models when
  verbose is not specified in the control settings.
* Running netdx diagnostics with offset terms in the formation no longer generates
  an error.
* Simulating an SIR serosorting network epidemic model (status in the formation
  formula) no longer stops due to missing r.num in init.net.
* Fix bug when calling netdx for one simulation only with a network model fit with
  the full STERGM method (i.e., using the edapprox = FALSE in netest).

### OTHER
* The dissolution_coefs function now stores and prints the death/exit rate.
* Removed explicit parameters for xlim, ylim, and main from plot.dcm and plot.icm
  functions, although they still may be passed through the ... argument.
* Introduction vignette has been updated to list new EpiModel website.

<br>


EpiModel 1.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NEW FEATURES
* Added coef.form argument to netest for network model formation formulas with
  offset terms.
* Allow edge duration of 1 in netest when using the edges dissolution approximation
  (handles one-off partnerships in network models when using the approximation).
* Death modules for network models are now contained in one function, deaths.net,
  to facilitate replacement death modules from users. This is also now consistent
  with the death module for ICMs.
* Automated plotting of target statistic lines to plot.netsim formation plots,
  matching the methods of plot.netdx formation plots.

### BUG FIXES
* netdx now simulates from a different starting network at the begining of each
  dynamic simulation, eliminating correlation at time 1 across simulations.
* Can now pass status.vector into init.net for bipartite simulations.
* Several plotting and printing bugs fixed.
* Fixed bug in network models for open populations in which an attribute was
  passed to the network in the formation formula (e.g., serostatus mixing models).

### OTHER
* Added internal test structure for build checking.
* Added a help file document for building ICM modules at ?modules.icm.
* Expanded and clarified tutorial documentation, available at:
  http://statnet.github.io/EpiModel

EpiModel 1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Model parameterization for all model classes has been substantially revised
  to improve organization and ability for expansion. Whereas previous models
  required input of parameters directly into the main functions (now: dcm, icm,
  and netsim), now the parameters are input into three parameter-processing
  functions: param, init, and control. The param function sets the core
  epidemic parameters, the init function sets the initial conditions, and the
  control function specifies other model settings. These functions are
  class-specific, so each function has a .dcm, .icm, or .net suffix.

* Modeling functions have been renamed for clarity and consistency:
  - dcm is now used for deterministic compartmental models (replaces epiDCM)
  - icm is now used for stochastic individual contact models (replaces epiICM)
  - netest is now used for network model estimation (replaces epiNet.est)
  - netsim is now used for network model simulation (replaces epiNet.simTrans)

* Network models with independence between epidemic/demographic processes and
  network structures (independent models) were previously first simulated with
  epiNet.simNet, and then those pre-simulated networks were input to
  epiNet.simTrans. Now the network model simulation is all handled within the
  simulation function, netsim.

* Network model diagnostics have been moved from within the network estimation
  process (netest) to their own function: netdx. The parameter names for running,
  printing, and plotting the results of these diagnostics have been updated for
  consistency. See ?netdx and related functions.

* Internal model functions have been significantly revised to improve efficiency.

* The dcm function can handle model functions, parameter sets, and initial
  conditions of arbitrary complexity. See the HTML vignette on this topic at:
  http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/NewDCMs.html

* Moved the package vignettes external to the package to reduce package size and
  build time. They are now available at the EpiModel homepage at:
  http://statnet.org/trac/wiki/EpiModel
