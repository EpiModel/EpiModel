#'
#' @description Sets the epidemic parameters for deterministic compartmental
#'              models simulated with \code{dcm}.
#'
#' @param inf.prob probability of infection per transmissible act between
#'        a susceptible and an infected person. In two-group models, this is the
#'        probability of infection for the group 1 members.
#' @param act.rate average number of transmissible acts per person per unit time.
#'        For two-group models, this is the number of acts per group 1 persons
#'        per unit time; a balance between the acts in groups 1 and 2 is necessary,
#'        and set using the \code{balance} parameter (see details).
#' @param rec.rate average rate of recovery with immunity (in \code{SIR} models)
#'        or re-susceptibility (in \code{SIS} models). The recovery rate is the
#'        reciprocal of the disease duration. For two-group models, this is the
#'        recovery rate for group 1 persons only. This parameter is only used for
#'        \code{SIR} and \code{SIS} models.
#' @param b.rate birth or entry rate. For one-group models, the birth rate is the
#'        rate of new births per person per unit time. For two-group models, the
#'        birth rate may be parameterized as a rate per group 1 person time (with
#'        group 1 persons representing females), and with the \code{b.rate.g2}
#'        rate set as described below.
#' @param ds.rate death or exit rate for susceptible. For two-group models, it
#'        is the rate for the group 1 susceptible only.
#' @param di.rate death or exit rate for infected. For two-group models, it is
#'        the rate for the group 1 infected only.
#' @param dr.rate death or exit rate for recovered. For two-group models, it is
#'        the rate for the group 1 recovered only. This parameter is only used for
#'        \code{SIR} models.
#' @param inf.prob.g2 probability of infection per transmissible act
#'        between a susceptible group 2 person and an infected group 1 person.
#'        It is the probability of infection to group 2 members.
#' @param act.rate.g2 average number of transmissible acts per group 2 person per
#'        unit time; a balance between the acts in groups 1 and 2 is necessary,
#'        and set using the \code{balance} parameter (see details).
#' @param rec.rate.g2 average rate of recovery with immunity (in \code{SIR} models)
#'        or re-susceptibility (in \code{SIS} models) for group 2 persons. This
#'        parameter is only used for two-group \code{SIR} and \code{SIS} models.
#' @param b.rate.g2 birth or entry rate for group 2. This may either be specified
#'        numerically as the rate of new births per group 2 persons per unit time,
#'        or as \code{NA} in which case the group 1 rate, \code{b.rate}, governs
#'        the group 2 rate. The latter is used when, for example, the first group
#'        is conceptualized as female, and the female population size determines
#'        the birth rate. Such births are evenly allocated between the two groups.
#' @param ds.rate.g2 death or exit rate for group 2 susceptible.
#' @param di.rate.g2 death or exit rate for group 2 infected.
#' @param dr.rate.g2 death or exit rate for group 2 recovered. This parameter is
#'        only used for \code{SIR} model types.
#' @param balance for two-group models, balance the \code{act.rate} to the rate
#'        set for group 1 (with \code{balance="g1"}) or group 2 (with
#'        \code{balance="g2"}). See details.
#' @param ... additional arguments passed to model.
#'
#' @details
#' \code{param.dcm} sets the epidemic parameters for deterministic compartmental
#' models solved with the \code{\link{dcm}} function. The models may use the
#' built-in types, for which these parameters are used, or original model
#' specifications for which these parameters may be used (but not necessarily).
#' A detailed description of DCM parameterization for built-in models is found
#' in Section 2 of the
#' \href{http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/Tutorial.pdf}{EpiModel Tutorial}.
#'
#' For built-in models, the model specification will be selected as a function
#' of the model parameters entered here and the control settings in
#' \code{\link{control.dcm}}. One-group and two-group models are available, where
#' the former assumes a homogenous mixing in the population and the latter
#' assumes a purely heterogenous mixing between two distinct partitions in the
#' population (e.g., men and women). Specifying any group two parameters (those
#' with a \code{.g2}) implies the simulation of a two-group model. All the
#' parameters for a desired model type must be specified, even if they are zero.
#'
#' @section Act Balancing:
#' In two-group models, a balance between the number of acts for group 1 members
#' and those for group 2 members must be maintained. With purely heterogenous
#' mixing, the product of one group size and act rate must equal the product of
#' the other group size and act rate: \eqn{N_1 \alpha_1 = N_2 \alpha_2}, where
#' \eqn{N_i} is the group size and \eqn{\alpha_i} the group-specific act rates
#' at time \eqn{t}. The \code{balance} parameter here specifies which group's
#' act rate should control the others with respect to balancing. See the
#' \href{http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/Tutorial.pdf}{EpiModel Tutorial}
#' for further details.
#'
#' @section Sensitivity Analyses:
#' \code{dcm} has been designed to easily run DCM sensitivity analyses, where a
#' series of models varying one or more of the model parameters is run. This is
#' possible by setting any parameter as a vector of length greater than one. See
#' both the example below and the
#' \href{http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/Tutorial.pdf}{EpiModel Tutorial}
#' for details.
#'
#' @section New Model Types:
#' To build original model specifications outside of the built-in models, start
#' by consulting the \href{http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/NewDCMs.html}{Solving
#' New DCMs with EpiModel} tutorial. Briefly, an original model may use either
#' the existing model parameters named here, an original set of parameters, or
#' a combination of both. The \code{...} argument allows the user to pass an
#' arbitrary set of new model parmeters into \code{param.dcm}. Whereas there are
#' strict checks for built-in models that the model parameters are valid,
#' parameter validity is the user's responsibility with these original models.
#'
#' @seealso Use \code{\link{init.dcm}} to specify the initial conditions and
#'          \code{\link{control.dcm}} to specify the control settings. Run the
#'          parameterized model with \code{\link{dcm}}.

#' @title Epidemic Parameters for Stochastic Network Models
#'
#' @description Sets the epidemic parameters for stochastic network models
#'              simulated with \code{\link{netsim}}.
#'
#' @param inf.prob probability of infection per transmissible act between

#' @param b.rate birth or entry rate. For one-mode models, the birth rate is the

#'        birth rate may be parameterized as a rate per mode 1 person time (with
#'        mode 1 persons representing females), and with the \code{b.rate.g2}
#'        rate set as described below.
#' @param ds.rate death or exit rate for susceptible. For bipartite models, it
#'        is the rate for the mode 1 susceptible only.
#' @param di.rate death or exit rate for infected. For bipartite models, it is

#' @param inf.prob.m2 probability of transmission given a transmissible act
#'        between a susceptible mode 2 person and an infected mode 1 person.
#'        It is the probability of transmission to mode 2 members.

#' Tutorial}.
#'
#' For built-in models, the model specification will be chosen as a result of
#' the model parameters entered here and the control settings in
#' \code{\link{control.net}}. One-mode and two-mode models are available, where

#' (those with a \code{.m2}) implies the simulation of a bipartite model. All the
#' parameters for a desired model type must be specified, even if they are zero.
#'
#' @section The act.rate Parameter:
#' A key difference between these network models and DCM/ICM classes is the
#' treatment of transmission events. With DCM and ICM, contacts or partnerships are
#' mathematically instantaneous events: they have no duration in time, and thus
#' no changes may occur within them over time. In contrast, network models allow
#' for partnership durations defined by the dynamic network model, summarized in
#' the model dissolution coefficients calculated in \code{\link{dissolution_coefs}}.
#' Therefore, the \code{act.rate} parameter has a different interpretation here,
#' where it is the number of transmissible acts \emph{per partnership} per unit
#' time.
#'
#' @section Time-Varying Parameters:
#' The \code{inf.prob}, \code{act.rate}, \code{rec.rate} arguments (and their
#' \code{.m2} companions) may be specified as time-varying parameters by passing
#' in a vector of probabilities or rates, respectively. The value in each
#' position on the vector then corresponds to the probability or rate at that
#' discrete time step for the infected partner. For example, an \code{inf.prob}
#' of \code{c(0.5, 0.5, 0.1)} would simulate a 0.5 transmission probability for
#' the first two time steps of a person's infection, followed by a 0.1 for the
#' third time step. If the infected person has not recovered or exited the
#' population by the fourth time step, the third element in the vector will carry
#' forward until one of those occurs or the simulation ends. For further examples, see
#' \href{http://statnet.csde.washington.edu/EpiModel/nme/2014/d4-tut3.html}{this tutorial}.
