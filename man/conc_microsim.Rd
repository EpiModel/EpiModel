\description{
Simulates an HIV-1 epidemic in a population of men and women
             with purely heterosexual mixing under varying scenarios
             of sexual partnership concurrency.
}
\details{


This function runs a microsimulation model of HIV-1 transmission in a purely
heterosexual context to investigate how the presence or absence of relational
concurrency in sexual partnerships affects the prevalence of disease
prevalence at the population level.

The parameters of the model include the initial number of susceptible
females and males, the initial number of infected females and males, whether
males and females are allowed concurrency, the mean degree of all persons in
the population, and the average duration of partnerships (in momths). As the
four examples below show, all parameters except concurrency may be held
constant to test the effects of concurrency.
}
\section{Epidemiology}{

HIV infection is simulated based on a four-stage disease progression model in
which persons transition from acute to latent to pre-AIDS to AIDS stages. These
transitions occur at deterministic intervals based on estimates of the average
time per stage.

The transmission probability to uninfected partners varies by stage of the
infected partner: it is highest in the acute stage and lowest in the AIDS
stage when no sexual acts occur. See the Hollingsworth reference for further
details.
}

\section{Model Assumptions}{

This model makes several simplifying assumptions about partnership formation
and dissolution, such as the phenomenon of all dissolving partnerships being
immediately replaced by a new partnership in the network. Additionally, the
user may specify whether concurrency is allowed, but not the level of
concurrency (it is calculated based on a binomial distribution with the
probability equal to the mean degree parameter). Therefore, this model serves
as an introduction to network modeling featured in the network class of
functions in \code{EpiModel}; there the user has much more control over the
network parameterization and simulation.
