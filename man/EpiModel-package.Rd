The EpiModel package provides functions for building, solving, and
plotting mathematical models of infectious disease. The goals of the package
are to provide basic tools for modeling in multiple frameworks for pedagogical
purposes, and to support users in developing and expanding these tools using
the package's utility functions for their own research.

\section{Model Classes and Types}{

EpiModel currently provides functionality for three classes of epidemic
models:
\itemize{
 \item \strong{Deterministic Compartmental Models:} these continuous-time
       models are solved using ordinary differential equations. EpiModel
       allows for easy specification of sensitivity models to compare multiple
       runs of the same model with different parameter values.
 \item \strong{Stochastic Individual Contact Models:} a novel class of
       microsimulation models were developed to mirror the deterministic models
       but add random variation in all components of the transmission dynamics
       system, from infection to recovery to vital dynamics (births and deaths).
 \item \strong{Stochastic Network Models:} using the underlying statistical
       framework of dynamic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) recently
       developed in the \strong{Statnet} suite of software in R, our network
       models simulate partnership formation and dissolution stochastically
       according to a user-defined statistical model, as well as disease
       spread on that network.
 }

EpiModel supports three infectious disease types to be run across all
of the three classes:
 \itemize{
  \item \strong{Susceptible-Infectious (SI):} a two-state disease in which
        there is life-long infection without recovery. HIV/AIDS is one example,
        although for this case it is more common to model infection stages as
        separate compartments (forthcoming in a future release).
  \item \strong{Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR):} a three-stage disease
        in which one has life-long recovery with immunity after infection.
        Measles is one example, but modern models for the disease also require
        consideration of vaccination patterns in the population (forthcoming
        in a future release).
  \item \strong{Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS):} a two-stage disease
        in which one may transition back and forth from the susceptible to
        infected states throughout life. Examples include bacterial sexually
        transmitted diseases like gonorrhea.

}

\section{Model Parameterization and Simulation}{

EpiModel uses three model setup functions for each model class to input the
necessary parameters, initial conditions, and control settings:
\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{param.dcm}}, \code{\link{param.icm}}, and
       \code{\link{param.net}} are used to input epidemic parameters for each
       of the three model classes. Parameters include the rate of contacts or
       acts between actors, the transmission per contact, and recovery and
       demographic rates for models that include those transitions.
 \item \code{\link{init.dcm}}, \code{\link{init.icm}}, and \code{\link{init.net}}
       are used to input the initial conditions for each class. The main
       conditions are limited to the numbers or, if applicaple, the specific
       agents in the population who are infected or recovered at the simulation
       outset.
 \item \code{\link{control.dcm}}, \code{\link{control.icm}}, and
       \code{\link{control.net}} are used to specify the remaining control
       settings for each simulation. The core controls for built-in model
       types include the disease type, number of time steps, and number of
       simulations. Controls are also used to input new model functions (for
       DCMs) and new model modules (for ICMs and network models) to allow the
       user to simulate fully original epidemic models in EpiModel. See the
       extensive documention linked on the control function help pages for
       further details.
}

With the models parameterized, the functions for simulating the epidemic
model are:
\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{dcm}} for deterministic compartmental epidemic models.
 \item \code{\link{icm}} for individual contact epidemic models.
 \item Network models are simulated in a three-step process:
 \enumerate{
   \item \code{\link{netest}} estimates the statistical models underlying
         partnership formation and dissolution. This function is a wrapper
         around the \code{ergm} and \code{stergm} functions in the \code{ergm}
         and \code{tergm} packages. The current framework for model simulation
         is one in which key target statistics guiding the formation formula
         from an egocentric sample of the population is passed along with an
         estimate of the average duration of edges in the network.
   \item \code{\link{netdx}} runs diagnostics on the dynamic model fit by
         simulating the base network over time to ensure the model fits the
         targets for formation and dissolution.
   \item \code{\link{netsim}} simulates the stochastic network epidemic models,
         with a given network model fit in \code{\link{netest}}. Here the
         function requires this model fit object along with the parameters,
         initial conditions, and control settings as defined above.
