\details{
The EpiModel software package provides tools for building, solving, and
visualizing mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics. These tools allow users
to simulate epidemic models in multiple frameworks for both pedagogical
purposes ("base models") and novel research purposes ("extension models").

\section{Model Classes and Infectious Disease Types}{

EpiModel provides functionality for three classes of epidemic models:
\itemize{
 \item \strong{Deterministic Compartmental Models:} these continuous-time
       models are solved using ordinary differential equations. EpiModel
       allows for easy specification of sensitivity analyses to compare multiple
       scenarios f the same model across different parameter values.
 \item \strong{Stochastic Individual Contact Models:} a novel class of
       individual-based, microsimulation models that were developed to add
       random variation in all components of the transmission system, from
       infection to recovery to vital dynamics (arrivals and departures).
 \item \strong{Stochastic Network Models:} with the underlying statistical
       framework of temporal exponential random graph models (ERGMs) recently
       developed in the \strong{Statnet} suite of software in R, network
       models over epidemics simulate edge (e.g., partnership) formation and
       dissolution stochastically according to a specified statistical model,
       with disease spread across that network.
 }

EpiModel supports three infectious disease types to be run across all of the
three classes.
 \itemize{
  \item \strong{Susceptible-Infectious (SI):} a two-state disease in which
        there is life-long infection without recovery. HIV/AIDS is one example,
        although for this case it is common to model infection stages as
        separate compartments.
  \item \strong{Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR):} a three-stage disease
        in which one has life-long recovery with immunity after infection.
        Measles is one example, but modern models for the disease also require
        consideration of vaccination patterns in the population.
  \item \strong{Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS):} a two-stage disease
        in which one may transition back and forth from the susceptible to
        infected states throughout life. Examples include bacterial sexually
        transmitted diseases like gonorrhea.
 }
These basic disease types may be extended in any arbitrarily complex way to
simulate specific diseases for research questions.
}

\section{Model Parameterization and Simulation}{

EpiModel uses three model setup functions for each model class to input the
necessary parameters, initial conditions, and control settings:
\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{param.dcm}}, \code{\link{param.icm}}, and
       \code{\link{param.net}} are used to input epidemic parameters for each
       of the three model classes. Parameters include the rate of contacts or
       acts between actors, the probability of transmission per contact, and
       recovery and demographic rates for models that include those transitions.
 \item \code{\link{init.dcm}}, \code{\link{init.icm}}, and \code{\link{init.net}}
       are used to input the initial conditions for each class. The main
       conditions are limited to the numbers or, if applicable, the specific
       agents in the population who are infected or recovered at the simulation
       outset.
 \item \code{\link{control.dcm}}, \code{\link{control.icm}}, and
       \code{\link{control.net}} are used to specify the remaining control
       settings for each simulation. The core controls for base model
       types include the disease type, number of time steps, and number of
       simulations. Controls are also used to input new model functions (for
       DCMs) and new model modules (for ICMs and network models) to allow the
       user to simulate fully original epidemic models in EpiModel. See the
       documention for the specific control functions help pages.
}

With the models parameterized, the functions for simulating epidemic models are:
\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{dcm}} for deterministic compartmental models.
 \item \code{\link{icm}} for individual contact models.
 \item Network models are simulated in a three-step process:
 \enumerate{
   \item \code{\link{netest}} estimates the statistical model for the network
         structure itself (i.e., how partnerships form and dissolve over time
         given the parameterization of those processes). This function is a wrapper
         around the \code{ergm} and \code{stergm} functions in the \code{ergm}
         and \code{tergm} packages. The current statistical framework for model
         simulation is called "egocentric inference": target statistics summarizing
         these formation and dissolution processes collected from an egocentric
         sample of the population.
   \item \code{\link{netdx}} runs diagnostics on the dynamic model fit by
         simulating the base network over time to ensure the model fits the
         targets for formation and dissolution.
   \item \code{\link{netsim}} simulates the stochastic network epidemic models,
         with a given network model fit in \code{\link{netest}}. Here the
         function requires this model fit object along with the parameters,
         initial conditions, and control settings as defined above.
