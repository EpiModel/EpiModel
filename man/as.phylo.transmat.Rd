\title{Convert transmat infection tree into a phylo object}
\usage{
\method{as.phylo}{transmat}(x, collapse.singles, vertex.exit.times, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{"transmat"}, the output from
\code{\link{get_transmat}}.}

\item{collapse.singles}{logical, DEPRECATED}

\item{vertex.exit.times}{optional numeric vector providing the time of death
of vertices, to be used to scale the lengths of branches reaching to
the tips. Index position on vector corresponds to network id. NA indicates
no death, so branch will extend to the end of the tree.}

\item{...}{further arguments (unused)}
}
\description{
Converts the edgelist matrix in the \code{transmat} object into a \code{phylo}
             object by doing the required reordering and labeling.
}
\details{
Converts a \code{\link{transmat}} object containing information about the history
of a simulated infection into a \code{\link{phylo}} object representation
suitable for plotting as a tree with \code{\link[ape]{plot.phylo}}. Each
infection event becomes a 'node' (horizontal branch) in the resulting phylo tree,
and each network vertex becomes a 'tip' of the tree. The infection events are
labeled with the vertex id of the infector to make it possible to trace the
path of infection.

The infection timing information is included to position the phylo-nodes, with
the lines to the tips drawn to the max time value +1 (unless
\code{vertex.exit.times} are passed in it effectively assumes all vertices are
active/alive until the end of the simulation).

If the transmat contains multiple infection seeds (there are multiple trees
with seperate root nodes) it will return a list of class 'multiPhylo', each
element of which is a phylo object.  See \code{\link[ape]{read.tree}}.

Note that in EpiModel versions <= 1.2.4, the phylo tree was constructed
differently, translating network vertices to both phylo-nodes and tips and
requiring 'collapse.singles' to prune it to an appropriate branching structure.
