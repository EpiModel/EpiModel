\description{
Estimates statistical network models using the exponential
             random graph modeling (ERGM) framework with extensions for
             dynamic/temporal models (STERGM).
}
\details{
`netest` is a wrapper function for the `ergm` and `stergm`
functions that estimate static and dynamic network models, respectively.
Network model estimation is the first step in simulating a stochastic network
epidemic model in `EpiModel`. The output from `netest` is a
necessary input for running the epidemic simulations in `\link{netsim}`.
With a fitted network model, one should always first proceed to model
diagnostics, available through the `\link{netdx}` function, to check
model fit. A detailed description of fitting these models, along with examples,
may be found in the
\href{http://statnet.github.io/tut/BasicNet.html}{Basic Network Models}
tutorial.

\section{Edges Dissolution Approximation}{

The edges dissolution approximation method is described in Carnegie et al.
This approximation requires that the dissolution coefficients are known, that
the formation model is being fit to cross-sectional data conditional on those
dissolution coefficients, and that the terms in the dissolution model are a
subset of those in the formation model. Under certain additional conditions,
the formation coefficients of a STERGM model are approximately equal to the
coefficients of that same model fit to the observed cross-sectional data as
an ERGM, minus the corresponding coefficients in the dissolution model. The
approximation thus estimates this ERGM (which is typically much faster than
estimating a STERGM) and subtracts the dissolution coefficients.

The conditions under which this approximation best hold are when there are
few relational changes from one time step to another; i.e. when either average
relational durations are long, or density is low, or both.  Conveniently,
these are the same conditions under which STERGM estimation is slowest.  Note
that the same approximation is also used to obtain starting values for the
STERGM estimate when the latter is being conducted.  The estimation does not
allow for calculation of standard errors, p-values, or likelihood for the
formation model; thus, this approach is of most use when the main goal of
estimation is to drive dynamic network simulations rather than to conduct
inference on the formation model. The user is strongly encouraged to examine
the behavior of the resulting simulations to confirm that the approximation
is adequate for their purposes. For an example, see the vignette for the
package `tergm`.

\section{Control Arguments}{

The `ergm` and `stergm` functions allow control settings for the
model fitting process. When fitting a STERGM directly (setting `edapprox`
to `FALSE`), control parameters may be passed to the `stergm`
function with the `set.control.stergm` argument in `netest`. The
controls should be input through the `control.stergm()` function, with
the available parameters listed in the `\link{control.stergm}` help page
in the `tergm` package.

When fitting a STERGM indirectly (setting `edapprox` to `TRUE`),
control settings may be passed to the `ergm` function using
`set.control.ergm` in `netest`. The controls should be input through
the `control.ergm()` function, with the available parameters listed in the
`\link[ergm:control.ergm]{control.ergm}` help page in the `ergm`
package. An example is below.

\examples{
# Initialize a network of 100 nodes
nw <- network_initialize(n = 100)

# Set formation formula
formation <- ~edges + concurrent

# Set target statistics for formation
target.stats <- c(50, 25)

# Obtain the offset coefficients
coef.diss <- dissolution_coefs(dissolution = ~offset(edges), duration = 10)

# Estimate the STERGM using the edges dissolution approximation
est <- netest(nw, formation, target.stats, coef.diss,
              set.control.ergm = control.ergm(MCMC.burnin = 1e5,
                                              MCMC.interval = 1000))
est

# To estimate the STERGM directly, use edapprox = FALSE
# est2 <- netest(nw, formation, target.stats, coef.diss, edapprox = FALSE)
