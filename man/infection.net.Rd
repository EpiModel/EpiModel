\title{Primary Infection Module for netsim}
\usage{
infection.net(dat, at)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A list object containing a \code{networkDynamic} object and other
initialization information passed from \code{\link{netsim}}.}

\item{at}{Current time step.}
}
\value{
The main \code{dat} object is returned with updated disease status and summary
incidence measures.
}
\description{
This function simulates the main infection process given the
             current state of the partnerships and disease in the system.
}
\details{
The main steps in this infection module are as follows:
\enumerate{
 \item Get IDs for current infected and susceptibles given the current disease
       status.
 \item Call \code{\link{discord_edgelist}} to get the current discordant edgelist
       given step 1.
 \item Determine the transmission rates (e.g., as a function of group).
 \item Pull the number of acts per partnership in a time step from the
       \code{act.rate} parameter.
 \item Calculate the final transmission probabilities given the transmission
       rates and act rates.
 \item Randomly transmit on the discordant edgelist.
 \item Conduct bookkeeping for new infections to update status on the nodes
       and calculate disease incidence.
}
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{discord_edgelist}} is used within \code{infection.net}
to obtain a discordant edgelist.
