\title{Modules for Stochastic Network Models}
\description{
Stochastic network models of infectious disease in EpiModel require statistical
modeling of networks, simulation of those networks forward through time, and
simulation of epidemic dynamics on top of those evolving networks. The
\code{\link{netsim}} function handles both the network and epidemic simulation
tasks. Within this function are a series of modules that initialize the
simulation, and then simulate new infections, recoveries, and demographics on
the network. Modules also handle the resimulation of the network and some
bookkeeping calculations for disease prevalence.

Writing original network models that expand upon our built-in model set will
require modifying the existing modules or adding new modules to the workflow
in \code{\link{netsim}}. The existing modules may be used as a template for
replacement or new modules.

This help page provides an orientation to these module functions, in the order
in which they are used within \code{\link{netsim}}, to help guide users in
writing their own functions. These module functions are not shown
on the help index since they are not called directly by the end-user. To
understand these functions in more detail, review the separate help pages
listed below.
}
\section{Initialization Module}{

This function sets up the nodal attributes like disease status on the network
at the starting time step of disease simulation, \eqn{t_1}. For multiple-simulation
function calls, these are reset at the beginning of each individual simulation.
\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{initialize.net}}: sets up the master data structure used in
       the simulation, initializes which nodes are infected (via the initial
       conditions passed in \code{\link{init.net}}), and simulates a first
       time step of the networks given the network model fit from
       \code{\link{netest}}.
}
}

\section{Disease Status Modification Modules}{

The main disease simulation occurs at each time step given the current state
of the network at that step. Infection of nodes is simulated as a function of
attributes of the nodes and the edges. Recovery of nodes is likewise simulated
as a function of nodal attributes of those infected nodes. These functions
also calculate summary flow measures such as disease incidence.
\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{infection.net}}: simulates disease transmission given an
       edgelist of discordant partnerships by calculating the relevant
       transmission and act rates for each edge, and then updating the nodal
       attributes and summary statistics.
 \item \code{\link{recovery.net}}: simulates recovery from infection either to
       a lifelong immune state (for SIR models) or back to the susceptible
       state (for SIS models), as a function of the recovery rate parameters
       specified \code{\link{param.net}}.
}
}

\section{Demographic Modules}{

Demographics such as birth and death processes are simulated at each time
step to update entries into and exits from the network. These are used in
dependent network models, in which the network is resimulated at each time
step to account for the nodal changes affecting the edges.
\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{deaths.net}}: randomly simulates death for nodes given
       their disease status (susceptible, infected, recovered), and their
       mode-specific death rates specified in \code{\link{param.net}}. Deaths
       involve deactivating nodes, which are then deleted from the network
       if \code{delete.nodes=TRUE} is set in \code{\link{control.net}}.
 \item \code{\link{births.net}}: randomly simulates new births into the network
       given the current population size and the birth rate specified in the
       \code{b.rate} parameters. This involves adding new nodes into the network.
}
}

\section{Network Resimulation Module}{

In dependent network models, the network object is resimulated at each time
step to account for changes in the size of the network (changed through entries
and exits), and the disease status of the nodes.
\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{edges_correct}}: adjusts the edges coefficient of a network
       model to account for changes in the population size due to entries and
       exits. The default behavior is to preserve the mean degree (average
       number of edges per person) in response to change population sizes.
 \item \code{\link{resim_nets}}: resimulates the network object one time step
       forward given the set of formation and dissolution coefficients estimated
       in \code{\link{netest}}. This function also deletes the inactive nodes
       if the \code{delete.nodes} control is set to \code{TRUE}.
}
}

\section{Bookkeeping Module}{

Network simulations require bookkeeping at each time step to calculate the
summary epidemiological statistics used in the model output analysis.
\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{get_prev.net}}: calculates the number in each disease state
       (susceptible, infected, recovered) at each time step for those active
       nodes in the network. If the \code{epi.by} control is used, it calculates
       these statistics by a set of nodal attributes.
 \item \code{\link{verbose.net}}: summarizes the current state of the simulation
       and prints this to the console.
}
