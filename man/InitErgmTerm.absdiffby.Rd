\description{
This function defines and initialize the absdiffby ERGM term
             that allows for targeting age homophily by sex.
}
\details{
This ERGM user term was written to allow for age-based homophily in partnership
formation that is asymetric by sex. The absdiff component targets age homophily
while the by component allows that to be structed by a binary attribute such
as "male", in order to enforce an offset in the average difference.
