\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{EpiModel} object of class \code{netdx}.}

\item{type}{Plot type, with options of \code{"formation"} for network
model formation statistics, \code{"duration"} for dissolution model
statistics for average edge duration, or \code{"dissolution"} for
dissolution model statistics for proportion of ties dissolved per time
step.}

\item{method}{Plot method, with options of \code{"l"} for line plots and
\code{"b"} for boxplots.}

\item{sim}{Vector of simulation numbers to plot, with the default to plot
all simulations.}

to \code{\link{netdx}}, with the default to plot all statistics
contained in the object.}

\item{sim.lines}{If \code{TRUE}, plot individual simulation lines.}

\item{sim.col}{Vector of standard R colors for individual simulation lines,
with default colors based on \code{RColorBrewer} color palettes.}

\item{sim.lwd}{Line width for individual simulation lines, with defaults based
on number of simulations (more simulations results in thinner lines).}

range implied by the argument (0.5 is the middle 50% of the data).
If \code{FALSE}, suppress polygon from plot.}

\item{qnts.col}{Vector of any standard R color format for polygons.}

\item{qnts.alpha}{Transparency level for quantile polygons, where 0 =
transparent and 1 = opaque (see \code{\link{transco}}).}

the statistic of interest.}

\item{targ.col}{Vector of standard R colors for target statistic lines, with
default colors based on \code{RColorBrewer} color palettes.}

otherwise use one plot window per target statistic.}

\description{
Plots dynamic network model diagnostics calculated in
             \code{netdx}.
}
\details{
The plot function for \code{netdx} objects will generate plots of two types of
model diagnostic statistics that run as part of the diagnostic tools within
that function. The \code{formation} plot shows the summary statistics
requested in \code{nwstats.formula}, where the default includes those
statistics in the network model formation formula specified in the original
call to \code{\link{netest}}.

The \code{duration} plot shows the average age of existing edges at each time
step, up until the maximum time step requested. This is calculated with the
\code{\link{edgelist_meanage}} function. The age is used as an estimator of
the average duration of edges in the equilibrium state.

The \code{dissolution} plot shows the proportion of the extant ties that are
dissolved at each time step, up until the maximum time step requested.
Typically the proportion of ties that are dissolved is the reciprocal of the
mean relational duration. This plot thus contains similar information to that
in the duration plot, but should reach its expected value more quickly, since
it is not subject to censoring.

The \code{plots.joined} argument will control whether the statistics
in the \code{formation} plot are joined in one plot or plotted separately.
The default is based on the number of network statistics requested. The
layout of the separate plots within the larger plot window is also based on
the number of statistics.
