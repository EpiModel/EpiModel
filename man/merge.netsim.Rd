\usage{
\method{merge}{netsim}(
  x,
  y,
  keep.transmat = TRUE,
  keep.network = TRUE,
  keep.nwstats = TRUE,
  keep.other = TRUE,
  param.error = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An `EpiModel` object of class `\link{netsim}`.}

\item{y}{Another `EpiModel` object of class `\link{netsim}`,
with the identical model parameterization as `x`.}

\item{keep.transmat}{If `TRUE`, keep the transmission matrices from the
original `x` and `y` elements. Note: transmission matrices
only saved when (`tergmLite == FALSE`).}

\item{keep.network}{If `TRUE`, keep the `networkDynamic` objects
from the original `x` and `y` elements. Note: network
only saved when (`tergmLite == FALSE`).}

\item{keep.nwstats}{If `TRUE`, keep the network statistics (as set by
the `nwstats.formula` parameter in `control.netsim`) from
the original `x` and `y` elements.}

\item{keep.other}{If `TRUE`, keep the other simulation elements (as set
by the `save.other` parameter in `control.netsim`) from the
original `x` and `y` elements.}

\item{param.error}{If `TRUE`, if `x` and `y` have different
params (in `param.net`) or controls (passed in `control.net`)
an error will prevent the merge. Use `FALSE` to override that
check.}

\item{...}{Additional merge arguments (not currently used).}

\description{
Merges epidemiological data from two independent simulations of
             stochastic network models from `netsim`.
}
\details{
This merge function combines the results of two independent simulations of
`\link{netsim}` class models, simulated under separate function calls. The
model parameterization between the two calls must be exactly the same, except
for the number of simulations in each call. This allows for manual
parallelization of model simulations.

This merge function does not work the same as the default merge, which allows
for a combined object where the structure differs between the input elements.
Instead, the function checks that objects are identical in model parameterization
in every respect (except number of simulations) and binds the results.
