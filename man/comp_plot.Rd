\title{Plot Compartment Diagram for Epidemic Models}
\usage{
comp_plot(x, at, digits, ...)

\method{comp_plot}{dcm}(x, at = 1, digits = 3, run = 1, ...)

\method{comp_plot}{icm}(x, at = 1, digits = 3, ...)

\method{comp_plot}{netsim}(x, at = 1, digits = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{EpiModel} object of class \code{dcm}, \code{icm}, or
\code{netsim}.}

\item{at}{Time step for model statistics.}

\item{digits}{Number of significant digits to print.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to plot (not currently used).}

\item{run}{Model run number, for \code{dcm} class models with multiple runs
(sensitivity analyses).}
}
\description{
Plots a compartment flow diagram for deterministic compartmental
             models, stochastic individual contact models, and stochastic
             network models.
}
\details{
The \code{comp_plot} function provides a visual summary of an epidemic model
at a specific time step. The information contained in \code{comp_plot} is the
same as in the \code{summary} functions for a model, but presented graphically
as a compartment flow diagram.

For \code{dcm} class plots, specify the model run number if the model contains
multiple runs, as in a sensitivity analysis. For \code{icm} and \code{netsim}
class plots, the \code{run} argument is not used; the plots show the means and
standard deviations across simulations at the specified time step.

These plots are currently limited to one-group and one-mode models for each of
the three model classes. That functionality may be expanded in future software
releases.

\examples{
## Example 1: DCM SIR model with varying act.rate
param <- param.dcm(inf.prob = 0.2, act.rate = 5:7,
                   rec.rate = 1/3, b.rate = 1/90, ds.rate = 1/100,
                   di.rate = 1/35, dr.rate = 1/100)
init <- init.dcm(s.num = 1000, i.num = 1, r.num = 0)
control <- control.dcm(type = "SIR", nsteps = 25, verbose = FALSE)
mod1 <- dcm(param, init, control)
comp_plot(mod1, at = 25, run = 3)

## Example 2: ICM SIR model with 3 simulations
param <- param.icm(inf.prob = 0.2, act.rate = 3, rec.rate = 1/50,
                   b.rate = 1/100, ds.rate = 1/100,
                   di.rate = 1/90, dr.rate = 1/100)
init <- init.icm(s.num = 500, i.num = 1, r.num = 0)
control <- control.icm(type = "SIR", nsteps = 25,
                       nsims = 3, verbose = FALSE)
mod2 <- icm(param, init, control)
comp_plot(mod2, at = 25, digits = 1)
