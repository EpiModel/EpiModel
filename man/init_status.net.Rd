\title{Disease Status Initialization Module for netsim}
\usage{
init_status.net(dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Master list object containing a \code{networkDynamic} object and other
       initialization information passed from \code{\link{netsim}}.}
}
\description{
This function sets the initial disease status on the
             network given the specified initial conditions.
}
\details{
This internal function sets, either randomly or deterministically, the nodes
that are infected at the starting time of network simulations, \eqn{t_1}.
If the number to be initially infected is passed, this function may set the
initial number infected based on the number specified, either as a a set of
random draws from a binomial distribution or as the exact number specified. In
either case, the specific nodes infected are a random sample from the network.
In contrast, a set of specific nodes may be infected by passing the vector to
\code{\link{netsim}}.

This module sets the time of infection for those nodes set infected
at the starting time of network simulations, \eqn{t_1}. For vital
dynamics models, the infection time for those nodes is a random draw from an
exponential distribution with the rate parameter defined by the \code{di.rate}
argument. For models without vital dynamics, the infection time is a random
draw from a uniform distribution of integers with a minimum of 1 and a maximum
of the number of time steps in the model. In both cases, to set the infection
times to be in the past, these times are multiplied by -1, and 2 is added to
allow for possible infection times up until step 2, when the disease simulation
time loop starts.
