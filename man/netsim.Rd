\usage{
netsim(x, param, init, control)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Fitted network model object, as an object of class \code{netest}.
Alternatively, if restarting a previous simulation, may be an object of
class \code{netsim}.}

\item{param}{Model parameters, as an object of class \code{param.net}.}

\item{init}{Initial conditions, as an object of class \code{init.net}.}

\item{control}{Control settings, as an object of class
       \code{control.net}.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{netsim} with the following elements:
\itemize{
 \item \strong{param:} the epidemic parameters passed into the model through
       \code{param}, with additional parameters added as necessary.
 \item \strong{control:} the control settings passed into the model through,
       \code{control}, with additional controls added as necessary.
 \item \strong{epi:} a list of of data frames, one for each epidemiological
       output from the model. Outputs for built-in models always include the
       size of each compartment, as well as flows in, out, and between
       compartments.
 \item \strong{stats:} a list containing two sublists, \code{nwstats} for any
       network statistics saved in the simulation, and \code{transmat} for
       the transmission matrix saved in the simulation. See
       \code{\link{control.net}} and the Tutorial for further details.
 \item \strong{network:} a list of \code{networkDynamic} objects (or
       \code{network} objects if \code{delete.nodes} was set to \code{TRUE}),
       one for each model simulation.

\details{
Stochastic network models move beyond stochastic individual contact models by
explicitly modeling phenomena within and across edges (pairs of nodes that
remain connected) over time. This enables edges to have duration, allowing for
repeated transmission-related acts within the same dyad, specification of edge
formation and dissolution rates, control over the temporal sequencing of
multiple edges, and specification of network-level features. A detailed
description of these models, along with examples, is found in the
the \href{http://statnet.github.io/tut/BasicNet.html}{Basic Network Models}
tutorial.

The \code{netsim} function performs modeling of both the built-in model types
and original models. Built-in model types include one-mode and bipartite models
with disease types for Susceptible-Infected (SI), Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR), and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS).

Original models may be parameterized by writing new process modules that
either take the place of existing modules (for example, disease recovery), or
supplement the set of existing processes with a new one contained in an new
module. This functionality is documented in the
\href{http://statnet.github.io/tut/NewNet.html}{Solving New Network Models}
tutorial. The list of modules within \code{netsim} available for modification
is listed in \code{\link{modules.net}}.

\examples{

## Example 1: Independent SI Model
# Initialize network and set network model parameters
nw <- network.initialize(n = 100, bipartite = 50, directed = FALSE)
formation <- ~ edges
target.stats <- 50
dissolution <- ~ offset(edges)
duration <- 20
coef.diss <- dissolution_coefs(dissolution, duration)

# Estimate the ERGM models (see help for netest)
# Skipping model diagnostics for this, but one should always run these
est1 <- netest(nw, formation, dissolution,
               target.stats, coef.diss, verbose = FALSE)

# Parameters, initial conditions, and controls for model
param <- param.net(inf.prob = 0.3, inf.prob.m2 = 0.15)
init <- init.net(i.num = 10, i.num.m2 = 10)
control <- control.net(type = "SI", nsteps = 100, nsims = 5,
                       verbose.int = 0)

# Run the model simulation
mod1 <- netsim(est1, param, init, control)

# Print, plot, and summarize the results
mod1
plot(mod1)
summary(mod1, at = 50)

## Example 2: Dependent SIR Model
# Recalculate dissolution coefficient with death rate
coef.diss <- dissolution_coefs(dissolution, duration, d.rate = 0.0021)

# Reestimate the model with new coefficient
est2 <- netest(nw, formation, dissolution,
               target.stats, coef.diss, verbose = FALSE)

# Reset parameters to include demographic rates
param <- param.net(inf.prob = 0.3, inf.prob.m2 = 0.15,
                   rec.rate = 0.02, rec.rate.m2 = 0.02,

                   dr.rate = 0.001, dr.rate.m2 = 0.001)
init <- init.net(i.num = 10, i.num.m2 = 10,
                 r.num = 0, r.num.m2 = 0)
control <- control.net(type = "SIR", nsteps = 100, nsims = 5)

# Simulate the model with new network fit
mod2 <- netsim(est2, param, init, control)

# Print, plot, and summarize the results
