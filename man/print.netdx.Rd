\description{
Prints basic information and statistics from a \code{netdx}
             object.
}
\details{
Given a \code{netdx} object, \code{print.netdx} prints the diagnostic method
(static/dynamic), number of simulations, and (if dynamic) the number of time
steps per simulation used in generating the \code{netdx} object, as well as
printing the formation statistics table and (if present) the duration and
dissolution statistics tables.  The statistics tables are interpreted as
follows.

Each row has the name of a particular network statistic.  In the formation
table, these correspond to actual network statistics in the obvious way.
In the duration and dissolution tables, these correspond to dissolution
model dyad types: in a homogeneous dissolution model, all dyads are of the
\code{edges} type; in a heterogeneous dissolution model, a dyad with a
nonzero \code{nodematch} or \code{nodemix} change statistic in the
dissolution model has type equal to that statistic, and has type equal to
\code{edges} otherwise.  The statistics of interest for the duration and
dissolution tables are, respectively, the mean age of extant edges and the
edge dissolution rate, broken down by dissolution model dyad type.  (The
current convention is to treat the mean age and dissolution rate for a
particular dissolution dyad type as 0 on time steps with no edges of that
type; this behavior may be changed in the future.)

The columns are named \code{Target}, \code{Sim Mean}, \code{Pct Diff}, and
\code{Sim SD}.  For the formation table, \code{Sim Mean} refers to the mean
statistic value and \code{Sim SD} refers to the standard deviation in the
statistic value, across all time steps in all simulations in the dynamic
case, and across all sampled networks in the static case.  For the duration
and dissolution tables, \code{Sim Mean} refers to the mean across
simulations of the mean across time steps within simulation, and
\code{Sim SD} refers to the standard deviation across simulations of the
mean across time steps within simulation, for the age and dissolution
statistics defined above.  The \code{Target} column
indicates the target value (if present) for the network statistic, mean edge
age, or edge dissolution rate, and the \code{Pct Diff} column gives
\code{(Sim Mean - Target)/Target} when \code{Target} is present.
