\title{Stable Sampling Function}
\usage{
ssample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either a vector of one or more elements from which to choose, or a
positive integer.}

\item{size}{Non-negative integer giving the number of items to choose.}

\item{replace}{Should sampling be with replacement?}

\item{prob}{Vector of probability weights for obtaining the elements of the
       vector being sampled.}
}
\description{
Provides a sampling function useful for dynamic simulations, in
             which the length of the input vector may be multiple lengths and
             the size of the sample may be 0.
