(see details).}

to plot lines for one-group models but not for two-group models.}

polygon from plot.}

transparent and 1 = opaque (see \code{adjustcolor} function).}

(see \code{\link{grid}} for details), with default of nx by ny.}

to existing plot window.}

\description{
Plots epidemiological data from a stochastic individual contact
             model simulated with \code{\link{icm}}.
}
\details{
This plotting function will extract the epidemiological output from a model
object of class \code{icm} and plot the time series data of disease
prevalence and other results. The summary statistics that the function
calculates and plots are individual simulation lines, means of the individual
simulation lines, and quantiles of those individual simulation lines. The
mean line, toggled on with \code{mean.line=TRUE}, is calculated as the row
mean across simulations at each time step.

Compartment prevalences are the size of a compartment over some denominator.
To plot the raw numbers from any compartment, use \code{popfrac=FALSE}; this
is the default for any plots of flows. The \code{popfrac} parameter
calculates and plots the denominators of all specified compartments using
these rules: 1) for one-group models, the prevalence of any compartment is
the compartment size divided by the total population size; 2) for two-group
models, the prevalence of any compartment is the compartment size divided by
the group population size. For any prevalences that are not automatically
calculated, the \code{\link{mutate_epi}} function may be used to add new
variables to the \code{icm} object to plot or analyze.

The quantiles show the range of outcome values within a certain specified
quantile range. By default, the interquartile range is shown: that is the
middle 50\% of the data. This is specified by \code{qnts=0.5}. To show the
middle 95\% of the data, specify \code{qnts=0.95}. To toggle off the polygons
where they are plotted by default, specify \code{qnts=FALSE}.

\examples{
## Example 1: Plotting multiple compartment values from SIR model
param <- param.icm(inf.prob = 0.5, act.rate = 0.5, rec.rate = 0.02)
init <- init.icm(s.num = 500, i.num = 1, r.num = 0)
control <- control.icm(type = "SIR", nsteps = 100,
                       nsims = 3, verbose = FALSE)
mod <- icm(param, init, control)
plot(mod, grid = TRUE)

## Example 2: Plot only infected with specific output from SI model
param <- param.icm(inf.prob = 0.25, act.rate = 0.25)
init <- init.icm(s.num = 500, i.num = 10)
control <- control.icm(type = "SI", nsteps = 100,
                       nsims = 3, verbose = FALSE)
mod2 <- icm(param, init, control)

# Plot prevalence
plot(mod2, y = "i.num", mean.line = FALSE, sim.lines = TRUE)

# Plot incidence
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(mod2, y = "si.flow", mean.smooth = TRUE, grid = TRUE)
plot(mod2, y = "si.flow", qnts.smooth = FALSE, qnts = 1)
