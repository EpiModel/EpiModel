  ds.rate, di.rate, dr.rate, inf.prob.g2, act.rate.g2, rec.rate.g2, b.rate.g2,

}
\arguments{
\item{inf.prob}{Probability of infection per transmissible act between
a susceptible and an infected person. In two-group models, this is the
probability of infection for the group 1 members.}

\item{act.rate}{Average number of transmissible acts per person per unit time.
For two-group models, this is the number of acts per group 1 persons
per unit time; a balance between the acts in groups 1 and 2 is necessary,
and set using the \code{balance} parameter (see details).}

\item{part.acq.rate}{Rate of acquiring new partners per unit time, to be used
as an alternative to \code{act.rate} (see details). Currently only
available for one-group models.}

\item{acts.per.part}{Number of acts per partnership, used with the
\code{part.acq.rate} parameter to specify the total number of acts.}

\item{rec.rate}{Average rate of recovery with immunity (in \code{SIR} models)
or re-susceptibility (in \code{SIS} models). The recovery rate is the
reciprocal of the disease duration. For two-group models, this is the
recovery rate for group 1 persons only. This parameter is only used for
\code{SIR} and \code{SIS} models.}

\item{b.rate}{Birth or entry rate. For one-group models, the birth rate is the
rate of new births per person per unit time. For two-group models, the
birth rate may be parameterized as a rate per group 1 person time (with
group 1 persons representing females), and with the \code{b.rate.g2}
rate set as described below.}

\item{ds.rate}{Death or exit rate for susceptible. For two-group models, it
is the rate for the group 1 susceptible only.}

\item{di.rate}{Death or exit rate for infected. For two-group models, it is
the rate for the group 1 infected only.}

\item{dr.rate}{Death or exit rate for recovered. For two-group models, it is
the rate for the group 1 recovered only. This parameter is only used for
\code{SIR} models.}

\item{inf.prob.g2}{Probability of infection per transmissible act
between a susceptible group 2 person and an infected group 1 person.
It is the probability of infection to group 2 members.}

\item{act.rate.g2}{Average number of transmissible acts per group 2 person per
unit time; a balance between the acts in groups 1 and 2 is necessary,
and set using the \code{balance} parameter (see details).}

\item{rec.rate.g2}{Average rate of recovery with immunity (in \code{SIR} models)
or re-susceptibility (in \code{SIS} models) for group 2 persons. This
parameter is only used for two-group \code{SIR} and \code{SIS} models.}

\item{b.rate.g2}{Birth or entry rate for group 2. This may either be specified
numerically as the rate of new births per group 2 persons per unit time,
or as \code{NA} in which case the group 1 rate, \code{b.rate}, governs
the group 2 rate. The latter is used when, for example, the first group
is conceptualized as female, and the female population size determines
the birth rate. Such births are evenly allocated between the two groups.}

\item{ds.rate.g2}{Death or exit rate for group 2 susceptible.}

\item{di.rate.g2}{Death or exit rate for group 2 infected.}

\item{dr.rate.g2}{Death or exit rate for group 2 recovered. This parameter is
only used for \code{SIR} model types.}

\item{balance}{For two-group models, balance the \code{act.rate} to the rate
set for group 1 (with \code{balance="g1"}) or group 2 (with
\code{balance="g2"}). See details.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to model.}

\description{
Sets the epidemic parameters for deterministic compartmental
             models simulated with \code{dcm}.
}
\details{
\code{param.dcm} sets the epidemic parameters for deterministic compartmental
models solved with the \code{\link{dcm}} function. The models may use the
built-in types, for which these parameters are used, or original model
specifications for which these parameters may be used (but not necessarily).
A detailed description of DCM parameterization for built-in models is found
in the
\href{http://statnet.github.io/tut/BasicDCMs.html}{Basic DCMs} tutorial.

For built-in models, the model specification will be selected as a function
of the model parameters entered here and the control settings in
\code{\link{control.dcm}}. One-group and two-group models are available, where
the former assumes a homogenous mixing in the population and the latter
assumes a purely heterogenous mixing between two distinct partitions in the
population (e.g., men and women). Specifying any group two parameters (those
with a \code{.g2}) implies the simulation of a two-group model. All the
parameters for a desired model type must be specified, even if they are zero.
}
\section{Act Balancing}{

In two-group models, a balance between the number of acts for group 1 members
and those for group 2 members must be maintained. With purely heterogenous
mixing, the product of one group size and act rate must equal the product of
the other group size and act rate: \eqn{N_1 \alpha_1 = N_2 \alpha_2}, where
\eqn{N_i} is the group size and \eqn{\alpha_i} the group-specific act rates
at time \eqn{t}. The \code{balance} parameter here specifies which group's
act rate should control the others with respect to balancing. See the
\href{http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/Tutorial.pdf}{EpiModel Tutorial}
for further details.

\section{Partnerships as Contacts}{

A common parameterization of contacts within DCMs for HIV/STI is to collapse
all acts to occur within a partnership. Standard DCMs do not permit mathematical
partnerships, as the force of infection is an instantaneous hazard. Therefore,
DCM partnerships simply embed all acts within one "partnership" by calculating
a infection probability per partnership with the formula: \eqn{1-(1-\tau)^\alpha},
where \eqn{\tau} is still the risk per act and \eqn{\alpha} is the number of
acts per partnership. Within EpiModel, \code{inf.prob} still specifies the
per-act transmission probability (\eqn{\tau}), but the \code{act.rate}
parameter should be substituted by \code{part.acq.rate} for the rate of
acquiring new partners and the \code{acts.per.part} for the number acts per
partnership (\eqn{\alpha}). Finally, this is currently only implemented for
one-group models.
}

\section{Sensitivity Analyses}{

\code{dcm} has been designed to easily run DCM sensitivity analyses, where a
series of models varying one or more of the model parameters is run. This is
possible by setting any parameter as a vector of length greater than one. See
both the example below and the
\href{http://statnet.github.io/tut/BasicDCMs.html}{Basic DCMs} tutorial.
}

\section{New Model Types}{

To build original model specifications outside of the built-in models, start
by consulting the \href{http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/NewDCMs.html}{Solving
New DCMs with EpiModel} tutorial. Briefly, an original model may use either
the existing model parameters named here, an original set of parameters, or
a combination of both. The \code{...} argument allows the user to pass an
arbitrary set of new model parmeters into \code{param.dcm}. Whereas there are
strict checks for built-in models that the model parameters are valid,
parameter validity is the user's responsibility with these original models.
